# Animal-Shelter
Contains a definition of what a single AnimalShelter object is. Each of these objects contains a dictionary structure
where the keys of the dictionary will be a string type representing an Animalâ€™s species. The dictionary values will be a 
list of Animal objects that the AnimalShelter contains. I created this project for my Intermediate Python course in 
Spring 2023.
